/**
 * Represents an open tank that can be filled with a fluid with different
 * temperatures. This tank is derived from self capacitance, meaning it will
 * have the same pressure on all nodes. Use only if there is no boiling, if it
 * boils, go for the HeatClosedSteamedReservoir to consider boiling pressure.
 *
 * <p>
 * Configuration: Set time constant with T = A / rho * g.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Some notes on where those equations came from:
 *
 * Effort: pressure p (Pa = N/m^2)
 * Flow: mass flow m. = dm/dt (kg/s)
 *
 * Time constant calculation (Time constant describes relation between pressure
 * builtup and inner folume change:
 *
 * p = rho * g * h           use h = V / A
 * p = rho * g * V / A       use m = rho * V as V = m / rho
 * p = rho * g * m / rho / A
 * p = g / A * m              this is obvious.   use m = int(dm/dt)dt
 * p = g / A * int(dm/dt)dt
 *
 * This matches the equation of the capacitance energy storage:
 *
 * effort = tau * int(flow)
 *
 * Therefore it is tau = g / A With tau = t/T, time constant can be
 * described as T = A / g and there is a method in the parent class
 * EnergyStorage to set this value.
 *
 * Replacing int(dm/dt) with m, which is obvious, also leads to the obvious 
 * equaiton of p = tau * m or m = p / tau. As p is the stateValue, this is how 
 * the thermal mass is set to the heathandler.
 * 
 * To get a fill height, simply invert first equation
 * 
 * h = p / rho / g
 * 
 * and remember that p is the effort value. rho is 997 kg/m^3 and g is 9.81 
 * m/s^2. 1/997/9.81 is 1.0224e-4 for meters or 1.0224e-5 for centimeters when 
 * using water.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Due to limitations of how heat fluids work, this tank must never be empty. It
 * could not implement a heat out fluid that way, so make sure your model will
 * never reach such a conditions (just implement an autoclosing valve or trigger
 * a pump trip).
