/**
 * Heat-Thermal-Exchanger element which is basically one side of a heat fluid
 * heat exchanger. The element itself is a heat element, meaning it has two
 * ports for heat fluid to flow through but no hydraulic properties itself
 * (therefore it extends HeatPassive). It represents a volume that can be heated
 * up or cooled down by adding elements and ports to a thermal domain system.
 *
 * <p>
 * It has an instance of an open origin and an effort source that will be
 * connected to a thermal system. This effort source serves as an interface
 * between the two domains, as both domains do not exchange any physical flow
 * with each other or exchange any pressure. The effort source has to be
 * connected to a thermal resistor.
 *
 * <p>
 * To model a heat exchanger for two heat fluid flows, this needs to be
 * instanciated twice for each side and connected with the origin elements with
 * a resistance in the thermal region. There is also a non linear resistance
 * available for this purpose, representing a more realistic behaviour.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible to create the thermal elements externally and just set them to
 * this class, the class just needs tho be connected to a thermal effort source
 * which serves as a connection between the domains towards the thermal system.
 *
 * <p>
 * The easy way is just to call initComponent(), this will create the thermal
 * elements and the thermal source will also be called from this element.
