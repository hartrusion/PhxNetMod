/**
 * Base class for thermal resistors which are to be placed between two heat
 * elements representing heat exchangers.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is a non-linear element designed to be placed between two heat exchange
 * elements which provide open origin elements. It can not be solved with the
 * provided linear solvers.
 *
 * <p>
 * As this is also connected to the heat handlers of the corresponding element,
 * initHeatHandler method has to be used to initialize this element.
 *
 * <p>
 * Using a regular resistor as thermal resistor for thermal flow between two
 * heat exchanger elements would allow to model a heat transfer between two
 * volumes but in reality heat exchangers are mostly built as counter flow heat
 * exchangers, requiring some extra modeling work. These thermal elements
 * present a way of doing so without the need of discrete volume elements.
