/**
 * Creates a duplicate network of given elements and nodes which can be a part
 * of a large network, solves it and transfers the results back to the given
 * elements. This network holds lists with new nodes and elements (called
 * network elements and nodes) derived from the original network (the original
 * part here is called linked elements and linked nodes) which is to solve.
 * Subnet descibes the part of the model which is to be solved. As the large
 * physical model can and should be divided into smaller, independably solveable
 * parts, the term subnet is used.
 *
 * <p>
 * The derived network contains only closed loops in terms of electrical
 * circuits. There are no open origins or self-capacitances present in the
 * network so the new network can be solved with means of electronic circuit
 * mehtods.
 *
 * <p>
 * The network is a first representation of the subnet in a more simplified
 * form, representing all subnet elements just as general elements which can
 * then be solved by means of electronic circuits. This also means that NO
 * solution for heat fluid or other extension will be provided, however, the
 * model should be able to calculate those things based on the results of this
 * network.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is basically the same as if you do those calculations manually on paper,
 * there are some methods available to provide solutions but you will always
 * have to some calculations left to do. Those are quite easy but they are still
 * there. Sames goes for this class, it will provide only effort and flow values
 * for all resistors, but this should be enough to get a fully calculated
 * network by just calling doCalculation on the remaining elements.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>There is a certain order to in which the network element has to be
 * set up. </strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Define which part shall be the subnet.
 * <li>Link all nodes from the subnet which shall be included in the network by
 * calling {@code registerNode} method.
 * <li>Link all relevant elements using {@code registerElement}. Only elements
 * with two node connections can be added. It will be checked that all nodes
 * connected to those elements were added to this network. The first origin that
 * is added will be the only one that stays in the model. All other origins will
 * be connected to this one or be replaced with effort sources.
 * <li>Call setupTransferSubnet to create and setup the network. This will
 * initialize additional solvers, also creating lots of networks, to provide
 * methods for solving.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Capacitors get replaced internally with effort sources to imply the effort
 * value of the subnet to the network. If they represent a boundary of the
 * network (for example, in fluid systems, a pipe network may be surrounded with
 * tanks to form a boundary).
 *
 * <p>
 * As this transfers a network to a strict linear electronic circuit, only
 * closed origins are available. All origins will be transfered to a single
 * ground origin, origins with a different effort value than the first found
 * origin will be replaced with an effort source which is connected to the
 * ground origin.
 *
 * <p>
 * The created network will be then further transfered into more networks as
 * necessary, most times to be solved with superposition layering which then
 * will create even more networks.
 *
 * <p>
 * Ultimately, this will be a copy of a part of a larger network, therefore the
 * part of the original network is called subnet. The solution of the network
 * will be transfered back to the subnet by copying all node properties from the
 * network to the subnet. As all variables are stored in nodes and not in
 * elements, this will result in all linked nodes to get the values from the
 * nodes of the calculated network.
 *
 * <p>
 * This will call prepare and docalculation-methods on all elements of the
 * subnet, but, as this subnet is only part of a large network usually, it will
 * not ensure the calculation for the whole model and it will not check that the
 * subnet is in fully calculated state. Only the network must be in fully
 * calulated state, otherwise a warning is issued.
