/**
 * Provides methods for updating the whole model. Calculation basically consists
 * of those steps:
 *
 * <p>
 * Remove "updated" flag of all values from previous calculations to mark those
 * values to be calculated again. Update EnergyStorage elements to apply new
 * internal state space values to the model. Others may also prepare some
 * calculation values.
 *
 * <p>
 * Try to calculate elements by running doCalculation, if possible. There should
 * always be something that is possible to calculate, elements will return true
 * at doCalculation if there was some successful calculation. This will also
 * update values and set the updated-variable to true to let other elements know
 * that they can now do something with those values.
 *
 * <p>
 * The whole model is calculated if isCalculationFinished returns true for all
 * elements. The state space variables will remain the same during all
 * calculation calls.
 *
 * <p>
 * This requires the model to be in such a simple way that it can calculate
 * itself. There is no solver that will solve an equation systems, like if there
 * are three or more resistances connected to one node. Use the provided network
 * solvers for such cases.
