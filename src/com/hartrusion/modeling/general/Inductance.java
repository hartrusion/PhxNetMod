/**
 * Stores flow energy. While at first glance it sounds like this would just
 * store flow energy to relase it later, it also acts as a flow limitation. Try
 * imagine pushing a car, you will feel the force with your hand as you apply
 * force to move a big mass. While not beeing present too much in hydraulic
 * systems, this is a base class for mechanical systems which always consider
 * moving masses.
 *
 * Supports 1 or 2 nodes where it will force its flow variables onto. More than
 * 2 nodes are not supported as this would require knowledge about how flow is
 * distributed.
 *
 * Positive flow value on this element means: flow into node 0, out of node 1.
