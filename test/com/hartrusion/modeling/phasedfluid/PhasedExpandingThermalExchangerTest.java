/**
 * Tests the behaviour of the phased expanding thermal exchanger. This element
 * has some special behaviour regarding its flow and is triggering some special
 * cases in the solvers already.
 * <p>
 * This test tests all scenarios by enforcing a flow rate through the element.
 * No solver is used, instead a method will invoke the calculation runs in a
 * specific order that is also expected to happen like this if a solver would
 * call it but this allows easier debugging here.
